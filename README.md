# USBGuard

### Overview

Personal computer USB port management, not intended for scale. The approach is a little different on every platform. Goals for each implementation are to provide options for:

1. Disabling all USB ports on your machine
2. Re-Enabling all USB ports on your machine
3. Whitelisting only certain USB devices
